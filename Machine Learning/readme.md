The assignment was based on two differents projects, two theoretical exams and short questionnaires after each theoretical class in order to see if we have 
understand the topic of the day. The first project was a kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/inclassfakejobs/leaderboard)
where I was a member of the greMLins team. Meanwhile, in the second project, we were expected to produce a brief research paper. In order to do this, 
I collaborated with Ã€lex Pujol and we elaborated a research in discovering faster matrix multiplication algorithms with reinforcement learning.

The marks are the following:

**Kaggle competition**: 7

**Paper**: 8.5

**First theoretical exam**: 9.5

**Second theoretical exam**: 8.7

**Quizzes global grade**: 9.5

**Final grade**: 8.5
