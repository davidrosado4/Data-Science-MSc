The assigment was based on two projects and a final exam. On the first project we had to create a visualization (dashboard) using Tableau. I chose the
COVID-19 data and I tried to create a visualization linking medical and economic issues. Moreover, I also studied how the pandemic has affected "work 
from home" and how has people's lifestyles changed, in the sense of buying food, has the frequency gone up or down?

The second project was a presentation in the class, in which we had to create a story related to the visualization made. The goal was to build a
storytelling through the visualisation made.

The marks are the following:

Dashboard: 8

Storytelling:

Final exam: 9

**Observation**: To realize this project I worked with Flàvia Ferrús and Àlex Pujol.
