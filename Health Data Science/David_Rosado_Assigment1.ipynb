    "\n",
    "- We provide you the variables already computed and saved in csv files, except age, elective surgery, pre-LOS and temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to compute the age and pre-LOS and consult the elective surgery information you need to merge tables PATIENTS, ADMISSIONS and ICUSTAYS. \n",
    "    - You should compute the age at the time the patient is admitted to the ICU from date of birth (dob) from PATIENTS table, then you can drop dob from the dataframe. \n",
    "    - For the pre-LOS you should compare intime from ICUSTAYS table and admittime from ADMISSIONS table. \n",
    "    - The elective surgery information is stored in the column admission_type of PATIENTS, ADMISSIONS and ICUSTAYS table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You need CHARTEVENTS table to get the temperature (measures in Fahrenheit and Celsius) and D_ITEMS table to consult the itemid for the measure.\n",
    "    - The variables can be duplicated, since they can come from Carevue or Metavision source systems of MIMIC-III, so you have to look for the different labels.\n",
    "    - You can use pandas.DataFrame.loc to look for the itemid corresponding to labels of the temperature in D_ITEMS table. If you do not know the exact label you are looking for, you can look for the strings in column label containing 'Temperature' using pandas.Series.str.contains as follows:\n",
    "    > df_ditems.loc[df_ditems.label.str.contains('Temperature', case=False, na=False, regex=False)]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have computed these variables you can read the rest of variables provided in the csv files and merge them into a single dataframe to pass it to the OASIS function (see [here](https://gist.github.com/tompollard/d4c216d0c4ad30481c99)) to compute the severity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Glasgow Coma Scale is stored in a different way in Metavision and Carevue. \n",
    "    - Metavision saves the three tests separately: GCS - Eye Opening,  GCS - Motor Response, GCS - Verbal Response\n",
    "    - Carevue saves a single test: GCS_total.\n",
    "    - We provide you 4 separate csv files with these information: GCS_E_metavision.csv, GCS_M_metavision.csv, GCS_V_metavision.csv and  GCS_total_carevue.csv\n",
    "    - You should concatenate the values and keep the worst one which corresponds to the minimum score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each csv file contains a dataframe with: [subject_id, hadm_id, icustay_id, variable_Time and variable value], except for the ventilation which just contains:  [subject_id, hadm_id, icustay_id, variable_Time], since the important information is if there is ventilation or not (YES or NO) and when has been installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalize the measures time. Use intime, which provides the date and time the patient was transferred into the ICU, as the reference value to compute the time that has passed since then until the variable measurement were taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After the normalization, you can filter the instances to keep the ones of the first 24 hours (or 48 hours) as observations to compute the OASIS score. \n",
    "    - Try to different strategies:\n",
    "        - All the instances of the first 24 hours.\n",
    "        - All the instances of the first 48 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the prediction, consider the following binary label:\n",
    "    - LOS < 4: short stay\n",
    "    - Otherwise: long stay.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Use Random forest to classify using a 5-fold cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As can be seen in the code to compute OASIS, the score is NaN if any of the considered variables has all its instances as NaN. MIMIC-III has many NaN values and the demo subset is more limited in the number. So, the number of samples with OASIS different of NaNs considering first 24h is just 8. You can use the first 48h but the number is also very limited and the performance of the proposed classifier will be very poor. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We suggest that you also try an alternative to compute the OASIS score. \n",
    "    - You can change the original code to consider the variable as 0.0 (state in normal range) when all instances of the variable are NaN. For that use np.nansum instead of using sum in the line:\n",
    "        > oasis_score = sum([oasis_prelos, oasis_age, oasis_gcs, oasis_hr, oasis_map, oasis_resp,oasis_temp, oasis_urine, oasis_vent, oasis_surg]). \n",
    "   \n",
    "- Analyze the results of the three different alternatives (Original OASIS with 48h, Modification of OASIS with 24h and 48h):\n",
    "    - Compare the mean accuracy\n",
    "    - Build the confusion matrix\n",

    "Once I have OASIS for every patient, I have trained a Random Forest classifier to predict if the Length of Stay is short (less than 4 days) or long (more than 4 days). The mean accuracy achieved in the 5-fold cross validation is 0.617, 0.390, 0.625 respectively. Notice that, in the second dataset, the one that NaN's are not allow to compute OASIS, we only have 53 rows of information, while in the others, we have 136 rows of information. As expected, the second, is the one with the worst performance. With regard to the others, we obtain a better accuracy in the third one, since we allow more data (samples of the first 48h are accepted instead of only 24h), although there is no significant improvement. Nevertheless, not only accuracy is important, but also confusion matrices are plotted in order to observe TP,TN,FN and FP, so we can compare each model in detail."

    "Finally, in the `third exercise` ([See the solution](#ex3)) I improved the prediction by learning from a multidimensional decision boundary considering more than one feature. It is important to remark that the features that I have selected have not been randomly chosen. The age, the preLOS, the admission type (dummies variables) and the ventilation have been added for each 'icustay_id' beacuse they are unic and informative for our goal (LOS). On the other hand, heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, MAP and urine, although they are informative, they have multiple values for each 'icustay_id', since multiple measures were taken for all of them and, therefore, we were not able to choose one. We could think to choose the worst, but this is not a simple task. For instance, for the temperature, which is the worst value, the higher or the lower one? As you can see, it is not immediate and this is why I have decided to not adding them. Nevertheless, for the Glasgow Coma Scale(GCS), if we observe the doucumentation of the OASIS ([documentation](https://alistairewj.github.io/project/oasis/)), we can deduce that the lower the GCS is, the worse it is for the patient. Hence, we can add this feature to our improvement dataframe to train our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have trained two different classifiers, a random forest and a xgboost, in which I perform hyperparameter tuning with the help of the function GridSearchCV. Notice that xgboost has a slightly higher performance than the random forest, reaching 0.781 in the xgboost and 0.774 in the random forest using the mean accuracy of the 5-fold cross validation. Again, you can compare the models in detail with the confusion matrix."
