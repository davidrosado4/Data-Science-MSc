The assignment was based on solving some theoretical exercises, solving some practical exercises with python and a final exam. The aim of the theoretical exercises was to understand the mathematical concepts behind all the algorithms, while in the practical exercises we applied all the studied algorithms. Let us give a brief description of the practical exercises. In practical 1, a basic overview of real analysis is given. In practical 2, we study the gradient descent algorithm. In practical 3, we work on the robustness of the linear regression. In practical 4, we study constrained optimization, focusing on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and finally, in Practical 5 and 6, we explore Support Vector Machines algorithm. The marks are the following:

**Theoretical exercises**:

Problem set 1: 9.5

Problem set 2: 10

**Practical exercises**:

Practical 1: 10

Practical 2: 9.72

Practical 3: 10

Practical 4: 10

Practical 5: 9.06

Practical 6: 9.06

**Final exam**: 9

**Final grade**: 9.5 (MH)

**Observation**: The practical exercises have been realized in collaboration with Flàvia Ferrús.
