## Delivery format
`main_doc.pdf` is the description of our work.\
`Reproduce_results.ipynb` is a notebook that needs to load models from disk, run evaluations and make a dataframe with the evaluations of the results.\
`train_models.ipynb` is a Notebook with the code needed to train and store models to disc.\
 The utils folder contains `utils.py`, a python module with the functions used in `train_models.ipynb` and `reproduce_results.ipynb`.\
 The skseq folder contains the necessary files of the structured perceptron method.
