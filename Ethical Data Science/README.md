The assignment was based on two deliveries and a final exam.

+ `Assignment 1`: On the first assignment we were asked to explore data from Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth applied to young offenders in Catalonia.
SAVRY is a risk assessment tool, that supports structured professional judgement. SAVRY contains 24 risk factors, in which each item (variables V65* to V88*) can have one of three values (low=0, moderate=1, high=2), for a total score between 0 and 48 points.
  + Human score: There is also a score by a professional (variable V56_@R1_resum_risc_global_reverse) that can be low, moderate, or high.
  + Recividism: In this dataset, there is information about whether people committed a new crime after the evaluation. The variable V115_reincidencia_2015 represents Recidivism (year 2015).
  + The variable V60_SAVRY_total_score contains a sum of scores in the risk items of SAVRY. This score can be seen as a baseline automatic method.<br />
The objectives of this assignment are:
  + To compare the performance of SAVRY and ML-based methods, in terms of both performace and fairness metrics.
  + To analyze the causes of unfairness.
  + To explore a mitigation strategy.

+ `Assignment 2`: Short essay giving my opinion on ChatGPT.

+ `Final exam`.
