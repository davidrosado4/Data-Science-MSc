The assignment was based on a Kaggle competition, a final exam and a presentation of a paper. The kaggle competition goal was on creating a Recommendation
system for the MovieLens dataset. The paper chosen for the presentation was: Two-stage model for automatic playlist continuation at scale, winners of the
RecSys challenge in 2018.

For the Kaggle competition, I worked with my friend Sara Bardaj√≠.
