In this work, we delve into the exploration and comparison of two powerful machine
learning models: neural networks and Bayesian neural networks. We begin by providing
a comprehensive overview of both approaches, elucidating their underlying principles
and architectures. Neural networks, known for their ability to learn complex patterns
and relationships, rely on deterministic weights and biases to make predictions. On the
other hand, Bayesian neural networks embrace uncertainty by incorporating probabilistic
modeling, enabling them to generate posterior distributions of model parameters and
predictions. To evaluate their performance, we conduct an empirical study using the
wine quality dataset. By implementing and training both models on this dataset, we
analyze their respective accuracies, robustness, and ability to handle uncertainty.
